This project implements logistic regression modle by c++ in visual studio on windows os. It is for my self-learning. Untill now, there are three projects: LROne, LRTwo and LRThree. LROne: binary classification, requires that the input value of each feature is the 0-1 value. LRTwo: binary classification, requires that the input value of each feature is the regulared float value. LRThree: multiple classification, requires that the input value of each feature is the regulared float value.

There are some data for training and testing. They are from net. Some of them are from the website of libsvm. The others are from other LR package.
